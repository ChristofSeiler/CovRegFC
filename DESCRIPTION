Title: Multivariate Heteroscedasticity Models for Functional Brain Connectivity
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Christof Seiler and Susan Holmes
Maintainer: Christof Seiler <christof.seiler@stanford.edu>
Description: Functional brain connectivity is the co-occurrence of brain activity in different areas during resting and while doing tasks. The data of interest are multivariate timeseries measured simultaneously across brain parcels using resting-state MRI. This package implements two heteroscedasticity models in Stan to analyze functional connectivity.
